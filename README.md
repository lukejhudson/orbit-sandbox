# orbit-sandbox
A simple game built around the force of gravity acting on celestial bodies in space. 

![Main Menu](Screenshots/MainMenu.png)

There are currently two game modes available: Sandbox mode and Exploration mode.

![Sandbox Mode](Screenshots/SandboxMode1.png)

In Sandbox mode the player has the ability to spawn a number of celestial bodies using the panel on the right of the screen.

Once a type of body has been chosen, click and drag on the screen to spawn it. The further the mouse is dragged, the greater the body's velocity as it spawns.

Spawn many bodies at once by selecting the 'Planetary System' body type. This spawns a large celestial body (randomly chosen between a star, white dwarf or black hole) and then a number of planets in orbit around this central body, and in turn spawns asteroids in orbit around those planets. Observe the bodies orbit around each other and combine together when they collide. Zoom in or out by using the scroll wheel, and move the camera around by holding the middle mouse button and dragging the mouse.

In Exploration mode the player controls a rocket placed in the centre of the screen. The rocket is initially spawned orbiting a planet within a planetary system.

Press and hold W to fire the rocket's engines and increase its velocity in the direction it is currently facing. Use the A and D keys to rotate the rocket anti-clockwise and clockwise respectively.

As the rocket moves around, planetary systems are procedurally generated to provide an endless universe to explore.

But try not to crash or the game will end!
